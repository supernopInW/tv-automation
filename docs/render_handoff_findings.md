## 2026-08-16 Cursor workspace sync

- Local workspace fast-forwarded `f05f509` → `e818d5f` to match `origin/main`.
- Handoff docs added under repo: `CURSOR_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/RENDER_PHASE1_CHECKLIST.md`, and this file.
- Next blocking action remains Render Environment Variables (authorization profile + Redis Internal URL), then manual redeploy of `e818d5f`. No secrets were written into the repository.

## 2026-08-16 read-only check

- URL: https://tv-automation.onrender.com/api/health
- Browser initially showed Render service waking up; after waiting the endpoint returned JSON with `status: ok`, `online: true`, and message `T&V Automation Server is running`.
- Reported public geo counts: 77 provinces, 928 amphoes, 7,364 tambons, 79,818 villages, 7,199 village shards.
- No login, upload, portal navigation, Draft, Submit, or secret access performed.
- This health response does not expose or prove the deployed commit SHA; commit provenance remains the last verified Render deployment record (`e818d5f`) and should be rechecked in Render dashboard if a later deployment may have occurred.

## Render dashboard read-only check (2026-08-16)

- Service dashboard: `tv-automation`, service ID `srv-d9o5jvlaeets73d4tfp0`, repository branch shown as `main`.
- Dashboard showed multiple events for commit `e818d5f`; the newest visible event was `Deploy failed for e818d5f` with `Exited with status 3`, and a manual deploy for the same commit had started shortly before.
- This means the latest deploy attempt for `e818d5f` was not successful. The health endpoint later returned `status: ok`, so the service may still be serving a previously successful instance or a prior deployment; deployment success and runtime health must not be conflated.
- Do not trigger rollback/redeploy or change Environment Variables during this handoff.

## Latest deploy log evidence (2026-08-16)

- Deployment URL path corresponded to `dep-da0hs2m7bikc73f6c5dg` for commit `e818d5f`.
- Render log showed Gunicorn worker boot failure and the exact application error: `Production authorization profile is not configured`.
- The failure is a startup configuration problem, not evidence that Workflow 26 save/submit was attempted.
- No secret values were read or recorded.
